<h1>Types of cells and differences between animal cells and plant cells</h1>
<p>Cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms. They are extremely small in size and are found in different variations and types.

The two main types of cells are eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and can be single and multicellular whereas prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus and can only exist in single-celled form.

<h1>The Flow Of Germination</h1>
<p>Every Plant starts out as a seed, This seed will only germinate when it will get the suitable conditions for it to live in, Such as : suitable temperature, suitable pH of soil , Mineral salts and many other things. After germination, the plant will grow into a seedling, and then a flowering plant allowing the plant to be able to reproduce and then a fully grown tree(not all plants become trees)</p>

<h1>The Process Of Photosynthesis</h1>
<p>Photosynthesis is a process in which plants synthesize food using (photons) light hence the name "PHOTO-SYNTHESIS" The word equation for photosynthesis is Water + Carbon Dioxide = Food(Glucose/Starch)+Oxygen. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H20 âž± C6 H12 06 + 6O2</p>

<h1>What Is A Lifecycle ?</h1>

<blockquote>Image by : Tolga Ulkan/unsplash</blockquote>
<p>A lifecycle is a way in which an organism changes throughout its lifetime, reproduction is a vital part of the lifecycle as it does not let the particular species go extinct.</p>

<h1>Lifecycle Of Plants</h1>
<p>Plants start out as a seed, this seed germinates and then becomes a seedling, In order for this seedling to reproduce, The seedling needs flowers, so the next stage would be that of a flowering plant/Mature Plant. </p>

<h1>Lesson Notes</h1>
<p>Germination is a process in which a seed grows into a mature plant.</p>
<p> A Lifecycle is series changes that on organism goes through throughout their life this includes reproduction. </p>
