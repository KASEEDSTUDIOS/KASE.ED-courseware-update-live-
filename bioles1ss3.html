<h1>What are cells?</h1>
<p>Cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms. They are extremely small in size and are found in different variations and types.

    <h1>Break Down : An organism</h1>

    <p>This is the basic flow : Cells - Tissue - Organ  - Organ System - Oragnism</p>
    <h1>Types of cells</h1>
    <h1>Discovery of the cell</h1>
    <p>Robert Hook took a close look at slices of cork using a simple magnifying device in 1665 that's almost 355 years ago.he took slices of cork not chunks or blocks but slices which enabled him to look at its structure under the magnifying device better. After he put it under the device he noticed distinguishable compartments in the cork slice he was observing.They looked like honey combs. He also noticed that each compartment was separated by a wall and a partition. Hooke named each one of these “cells”. He was actually looking at dead cells.

   <p> 
The two main types of cells are eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and can be single and multicellular whereas prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus and can only exist in single-celled form.
</p>
    <p>Bacteria and Archaea are the two types of prokaryotes, which means they are single-celled.

<h1>Difference between plant cells and animal cells 
</h1>
<p>
Plant cells have a rigid outer surface, are autotrophs (makes their food), has one main vacuole, normally plant cells are much larger than animal cells (accept egg cells), etc whereas animal cells do not have a rigid outer surface, are heterotrophs (feeds on autoroutes or other heterotrophs that eat autotrophs), have multiple small vacuoles, normally are much smaller than plant cells (except egg cells) etc. 
</p>



<h1>Similarities between plant cells and animal cells 
</h1>
<p>Plant and animal cells are both eukaryotic cells which means they both have a nucleus. Both contain membrane-bound organelles like the nucleus, mitochondria, etc. Also, both of their DNA is double-stranded and complex.
